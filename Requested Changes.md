I am trying to get the shadows to reflect properly, objects on the left should reflect left, and objects on the right should reflect to the right. 
The campaign chapters need to be taken out while keeping the missions in
The levels need tweaking to make them actually different from on another
I want to get rid of the scan pulse mechanic
Ideally, I would like to add some variability in ship design
